# The world's worse debugger

Over the course of multiple [**OALABS Twitch**](https://www.twitch.tv/oalabslive) streams we will build the world's worst debugger! The purpose of the streams is to learn more about the inner workings of debugging under Windows and gain a better general understanding of what our tools are doing when we are debugging malware.

## References

Much of the code in this project is heavily copy-pasted from multiple sources on the Internet. We will try to maintain a list of original sources here, but we may occasionally miss sources while on stream. If we missed something let us know so we can add it!
